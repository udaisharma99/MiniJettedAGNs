Cross-Matched Catalog of LLAGNs and FR0 Radio Galaxies

This repository provides a cross-matched catalog of low-luminosity AGNs (from the Palomar sample) and FR0 radio galaxies against multiple major surveys. The catalog integrates data from:

	•	X-ray: Swift 2SXPS, CSC 1.1, CSC 2.1, 4XMM-DR14
	•	Multi-wavelength / Optical: MORX
	•	Radio: NVSS, FIRST

Each source entry includes flux measurements, spectral properties, and variability information, enabling multi-band comparison and analysis of LLAGNs and FR0 galaxies across the electromagnetic spectrum.
